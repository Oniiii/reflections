How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    you saw the line where the problem was immediatly..

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    because you won't spend ages on finding bugs...

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    pro: you decide when, so the commits arent to large/small.
	cons: could forget to commit and f*ck it all up.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    because in coding multiple files could be affected by a change in one file.
	with docs there is no such dependency

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    get the log to see the different commits youve made, then use git diff and the ids of the two commits you want to check

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    because you can see the changes and impact also it would be easier to restore a non broken version

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    a project
